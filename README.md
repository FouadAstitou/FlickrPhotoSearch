# FlickrPhotoSearch

This is an app written in Swift 3 that fetches recent photo's from Flickr upon starting the app.
The app also has a live search enabeled which let's users search for pictures in Flickr using search terms. The pictures are shown in a
grid style using a collection view. When a picture is selected a larger picture is loaded in the detail view controller. In the detail 
view controller you can scroll to the previous or next items.
